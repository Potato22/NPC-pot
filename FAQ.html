            <p class="Answer">NusaPonyCon is Indonesia’s first ever convention dedicated to <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.</em> It is an event that is aimed at fans of the show from every demography. Regardless of your age, gender, or where you come from, we

            <p class="Answer">Extraordinary amounts of research and planning were taken place to pick this date, and we have secured the venue for our event on the 13th of July. We have selected this date based on the probability of crossing with the holiday season to
                allow as many people across Indonesia and Southeast Asia to travel to Jakarta and attend without needing to skip school or with taking minimal leave<br></p>

            <p class="Answer">Why conclude so fast? Flight tickets, accommodation, and expendables are not too pricy as of now. You are also given lots of flexibility to choose an accommodation between hotels and online room shares (such as Airy and RedDoorz) as our event
                venue is right in front of a TransJakarta bus stop that serves major bus routes and connects the busiest parts of the city. You can save up even more if you travel with a friend.<br><br>If you live in the island of Java, &nbsp;flying is
                not the only option - consider taking a train to Jakarta. Our venue is very close to Gambir station and within Transjakarta access from Senen and Kota intercity and commuter train stations. Consider making plans with friends from the same
                city and share a car for a road trip through the new Trans-Java highway, which costs significantly less than trains, buses, and flying.<br><br>We recommend that you save up as soon as you see the announcement. Five thousand rupiahs per
                day can go a long way!<br><br>If your parents do not consent your travel, you can consider taking a family trip to Jakarta, with NusaPonyCon being part of your travels. Your parents can attend the convention, too!<br><br>If you still can’t
                go, you still can support our convention by sharing our convention on social media. Follow us for the newest updates and let your friends and followers know!<br></p>

            <h1 class="Qtitle">What is my guarantee that NusaPonyCon will take place?<br></h1>
            <hr class="separator">
            <p class="Answer">NusaPonyCon’s team is composed of talents who have previously run conventions in Southeast Asia. Our founders have been involved with running <em>Project SEAPonyCon</em> in Thailand and Singapore for the years 2017 and 2018 respectively. It
                is the largest the region’s largest internationally-inclined convention which attracted attendees from across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. Despite this, the convention operates independently from Project SEAPonyCon but cooperates
                in supervision and operational advice, which has been proven to run successful.<br></p>

            <h1 class="Qtitle">What is My Little Pony?<br></h1>
            <hr class="separator-highlight">
            <p class="Answer"><em>My Little Pony </em>is a brand of toys that is owned by Hasbro. Since its inception in the 1980s, the <em>My Little Pony </em>brand has been advocating a line of toys that revolve around the world of magical talking ponies. <em>My Little Pony </em>itself
                has been through several generations of the franchise. <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, </em>the newest iteration of the brand, was first piloted in October 2010 following the vision and design of Lauren Faust, who has been known
                for her past works in other animated shows such as <em>Powerpuff Girls </em>and <em>Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends. </em>Faust’s vision allows a new art and storytelling style that is contemporary to the classic <em>My Little Pony </em>franchise,
                which aligns it towards newer designs of cartoon characters aimed at refactoring the brand and providing fresh, a new take on the franchise. <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic </em>is currently the most successful iteration of the
                brand, and have continued to nine seasons, with a theater movie and a related spinoff, <em>Equestria Girls. Friendship is Magic </em>forms the primary locus of NusaPonyCon, as the community of fans of the show is the one that mobilized
                such a massive interest group worldwide, including in Indonesia. We do, however, welcome every fan and content from across all the <em>My Little Pony </em>franchise!<br></p>

            <h1 class="Qtitle">What are bronies?<br></h1>
            <hr class="separator-highlight">
            <p class="Answer"><em>Bronies, </em>a portmanteau of “bro” and “pony”, is a term that is related to fans of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic </em>in general. <em>Bronies </em>Nowadays, the <em>brony </em>fandom has morphed into a diverse society, by
                demographics and by geographics, built and sustained by social media and internet-based mediums of interaction across the globe. With bronies sustaining friendships between land and sea, and beyond borders and miles, it is a community
                that proudly bolsters the values of friendships without prejudice.<br></p>

            <h1 class="Qtitle">Why run a convention?<br></h1>
            <hr class="separator">
            <p class="Answer">The idea of conventions was brought to life in 2011. Originally intended as a platform to congregate communities and show staff, it also became a trademark platform where bronies can foster social connections, grow their networks, exhibit
                or even sell their arts and crafts, and even as a stage to perform and tell the world of their projects, skills, and talents. Now, in nations worldwide, conventions became the greatest supporting pillars of the fandom, as a platform to
                share, communicate, exhibit, and perform to the community. But most importantly, it became a place for people to congregate and share from one interest, and foster networks and friendships to last. NusaPonyCon believes that Indonesia does
                not need to miss out from this experience, and we intend to bring it home in the best way possible.<br></p>

            <hr class="separator">
            <p class="Answer">Our convention is designed around a series of activities, talks, exhibitions, and performances that are mostly targeted to tweens, teenagers, and young adults. Put short, there’s a lot of talking and content that is based on fan works instead
                of the show itself, and not much of it is engaging to toddlers and young children. They may not find these appealing without any knowledge or familiarity to the <em>My Little Pony </em>franchise and its underlying fandom.<br></p>

            <p class="Answer">NusaPonyCon is <strong>not </strong>currently planning to invite any voice actor or show staff that has involvement with <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> to physically attend the convention. This is due to the costs associated
                with flying these talents down to Indonesia, which will have an extreme impact to the cost of tickets, which will make it simply unaffordable by our attendees.<br></p>

            <p class="Answer">NusaPonyCon is a nonprofit event that aims at providing everyone the best experience possible. That means, we explicitly refused to use sponsorships from companies and brands so that we will not have to alter our convention to accommodate
                for sponsor advertising requirements and dedicate it fully to you. That also means our founders entirely pay for this convention out of their own pockets, so we are taking zero revenue from ticket sales. We have calculated and set the
                price of our tickets to pay for our venue, and every attendee matters, as ticket sales and official convention merchandise (if any) are our only source of income. That said, this is the lowest our tickets can go, and purchasing them online
                is the cheapest option to get them!<br></p>

            <p class="Answer">You will receive a confirmation email and an electronic ticket generated by Loket.com that contains your proof of purchase and ticket. To redeem your ticket, you will have to bring this electronic ticket to the event. You will then be checked
                in and your ticket will be swapped with an official convention badge that confirms your attendance on the day. You can either show the ticket on your device or print it out for our check-in crew to inspect upon entry. When your ticket
                is redeemed, your badge gives multiple entries towards the venue - no more queueing or re-registering required when you leave and reenter the venue, as many times as you like!<br></p>
